## 🧠 How It Works
The LSTM model predicts the next character based on a sequence of previous characters.
#### You can control:
- seed → starting text
- temperature → randomness
- length → number of generated characters

##c✍️ Example Output
Seed: to be or not to be that is the

#### Generated:
to be or not to be that is the night  
when virtue walks in fair disguise  
and prince of denmark speaks again  
beneath the blood of broken skies
